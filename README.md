# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

To improve this project, I believe adding a sticky animated AI assistant to the that can answer any question a visitor may have would be benificial. Additionally, implementing a scrolling animation that transitions as the visitor changes sections of the page would make the webpage more attractive.
